        <article>The world of haircuts has seen some wild creations. From neon-colored spikes to intricate geometric designs shaved into the scalp, people are getting creative. One crazy style is the "mohawk mullet," a mix of a spiky mohawk in the front and a long mullet in the back. Then there are "illusion cuts," where hair is shaped into optical patterns, and 3D sculptures like towering afro mohawks. For a bold look, some go for "space buns," exaggerated buns on top of the head. And let's not forget the glow-in-the-dark hair, dyed with fluorescent colors that shine under black light. These cuts are all about pushing the limits of style and individuality.</article>

        <h1>HTML and CSS</h1>
        <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are two common tools used two create and present digital media. In the same way that English, MƒÅori and Sign            language are the official languages of New Zealand that are used to create traditional media, HTML and CSS are two of the official languages of the Internet used to create web              pages and many Apps.</p>
        
        <p>As with any language, digital or not, they change over time and have "official" versions. The current official HTML version is 5 and CSS is 3.</p>
        
        <p>HTML describes the structure and meaning of your media. It says, "this part is a heading" or "this part is a paragraph" or "this part is a navigation block". CSS is used for the         presentation. It tells your device how to display the media and can tell different devices to display the same media differently.</p>
        
        <p>For example, take a look at the <a href="https://learncoach.com/" target="blank">learncoach.com</a> web site as it appears on a mobile devices and on a desktop web browser. The          information is the same, but using CSS, the presentation is different.</p>
